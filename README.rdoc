== README

This project is the major one in CareerFoundry's web development course. I have built a production-ready e-commerce web app that:

- allows orders to be placed

- is free of bugs and security issues

- uses AJAX to make requests without reloading the page

- is well designed and interactive using Bootstrap and JavaScript

- uses WebSockets through ActionCable to send real-time updates to your users

- has tests for models and controllers
